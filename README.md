# Pneumonia_recognition

For this project, I used the Chest X-Rays Sample Dataset on Kaggle. The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). Using the dataset, I trained the machine learning model to predict if the patient has pneumonia or not with an accuracy of 88%. 

I used the Jupyter Notebook to build the model. I imported the dataset and CSV file from Kaggle, and built the Sequential Model using CNN layers. 

The dataset was imported from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data
